// Purpose: develop a C++ program with a game class that can 
//          (1) repeatedly display the current state of a single-player game
//          (2) prompt the user and receive input for the next move in the game
//          (3) check whether or not each input move is valid, and if it is update the game state
//          (4) detect the following three conditions: successful completion of the game, if the game has reached a point where no further valid moves are possible, or if there are still remaining valid moves available.
